 *     - The most important handles of the characteristic definition
 *       (see #getDeclHandle, #getValueHandle, #getLastHandle )
 *     - Its properties (see #getProperties).
 * This class also provide functions to operate on the characteristic:
 *     - Read the characteristic value (see #read)
 *     - Writing a characteristic value (see #write or #writeWoResponse)
 *     - Discover descriptors inside the characteristic definition. These descriptors
 *       extends the characteristic. More information about descriptor usage is
