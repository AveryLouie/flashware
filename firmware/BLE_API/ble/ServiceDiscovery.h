     *
     * @param  connectionHandle
     *           Handle for the connection with the peer.
     * @param  sc
     *           This is the application callback for a matching service. Taken as
     *           NULL by default. Note: service discovery may still be active
     *           when this callback is issued; calling asynchronous BLE-stack
     *           APIs from within this application callback might cause the
     *           stack to abort service discovery. If this becomes an issue, it
     *           may be better to make a local copy of the discoveredService and
     *           wait for service discovery to terminate before operating on the
     *           service.
     * @param  cc
     *           This is the application callback for a matching characteristic.
     *           Taken as NULL by default. Note: service discovery may still be
     *           active when this callback is issued; calling asynchronous
     *           BLE-stack APIs from within this application callback might cause
     *           the stack to abort service discovery. If this becomes an issue,
     *           it may be better to make a local copy of the discoveredCharacteristic
     *           and wait for service discovery to terminate before operating on the
     *           characteristic.
     * @param  matchingServiceUUID
     *           UUID-based filter for specifying a service in which the application is
     *           interested. By default it is set as the wildcard UUID_UNKNOWN,
     *           in which case it matches all services. If characteristic-UUID
     *           filter (below) is set to the wildcard value, then a service
     *           callback will be invoked for the matching service (or for every
     *           service if the service filter is a wildcard).
     * @param  matchingCharacteristicUUIDIn
     *           UUID-based filter for specifying a characteristic in which the application
     *           is interested. By default it is set as the wildcard UUID_UKNOWN
     *           to match against any characteristic. If both service-UUID
     *           filter and characteristic-UUID filter are used with non-wildcard
     *           values, then only a single characteristic callback is
     *           invoked for the matching characteristic.
     *
     * @note     Using wildcard values for both service-UUID and characteristic-
     *           UUID will result in complete service discovery: callbacks being
     *           called for every service and characteristic.
     *
     * @note     Providing NULL for the characteristic callback will result in
     *           characteristic discovery being skipped for each matching
     *           service. This allows for an inexpensive method to discover only
     *           services.
     *
     * @return
     *           BLE_ERROR_NONE if service discovery is launched successfully; else an appropriate error.
